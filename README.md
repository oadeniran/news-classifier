# news-classifier
A Neural network model to classify news into real or fake

## Model

The model was built with tensorflow and uses LSTM based RNN methodology

Dataset from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/fake-news-detection

## Deployment

Deployment was done with streamlit and can be accessed via - https://fake-news-classifier.streamlit.app/

## Notes

As is the case with most ML projects, the data goes a long way in determining how effectie the model is.

Hopefully more data can be gotten to improve the model's generalization
